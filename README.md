## Introduction

Jello is a Trello Clone. It offers collaborate tools to assist in project management and allows users to organize their workflow. Teams can easily manage their projects through a simple system of creating boards.

## Technologies

Jello is built with Ruby on Rails and PSQL as backend and React.js, Redux, and mostly Javascript on frontend. Styling is predominately on SCSS. Jello Live demo is using Heroku for deployment and libaries used so far are [@React-FontAwesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome) for icons.
